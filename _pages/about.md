I am currently an Assistant Professor at School of Intelligent Software and Engineering, Nanjing University. Before joining School of Intelligent Software and Engineering, I was an Assistant Researcher at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). I am also part of the [Group in Software Testing (GIST)](http://gist.nju.edu.cn/). My current research interest lies in the area of Fault localization, Combinatorial testing, Software Testing, Software Repair.

I received my PhD degree from Nanjing University in June 2019, under the supervision of Professor [Changhai Nie](http://gist.nju.edu.cn/~changhai/), and BSc from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in June 2011. I have been a visiting student at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) in 2016, under the supervision of Professor [Lei yu](http://ranger.uta.edu/~ylei/index.html). I have been a research assistant at University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) from September 2015 to April 2016, where I worked with Professor [Xiaoyin Wang](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~xwang/index.html). In 2013, I have been a visiting student at the hong kong polytechnic university,  under the supervision of Professor [Alvin Chan](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/alvin-chan).


I am looking for students who are interested in Software Engineering. Please feel free to drop me an email.
